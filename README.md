#What it's about?
We created a framework that imports realtime medical data from wearable devices (Apple Watch HealthKit), and registers with a unique identifier (Public Key) on the Ropsten Blockchain Protocol. Our frontend provides a portal for individuals and medical companies to exchange personal data for Ether (Ethereum's cryptocurrency). We also notify the user when a purchase is being made of their data using Twillio.

#What makes it unique?
We are leveraging the power of the Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG) and Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) to secure personal data during a B2C transfer, something that is inherent in the nature of Ethereum contracts.
